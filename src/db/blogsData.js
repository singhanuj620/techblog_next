        desc: 'Nearly half of SoftBanks Indian portfolio companies are close to or above breakeven, according to a report by investment bank Bank of America (BofA). The report said that these companies did a good job in cutting costs materially in the last 6-9 months, as startups grappled with a funding winter amid a deteriorating macroeconomic environment. The report highlighted that the cost-cutting measures resulted in reduced growth rates of 15-30 percent for startups, compared to their previous growth rate of 60-80 percent. However, the report also emphasised that these initiatives extended the companies cash runways, with approximately 94% of SoftBanks investee companies having at least a 12-month cash runway by the end of March 2023. Earlier this month, Moneycontrol reported that SoftBanks investee companies in India had cut costs between 50 and 75 percent over the last 12-15 months by implementing various cost-cutting initiatives. The Japanese investment conglomerates portfolio companies in India have laid off more than 7,500 employees since the start of 2022. SoftBank has been a prolific investor in Indian startups over the last decade, investing close to $15 billion. Most of these investments have happened in the recent past. But the investment conglomerate has changed its investing approach, particularly since 2019, when it established an on-ground team in India, its third-largest market after the US and China. The BofA report also argued the same.',

        shortDesc: 'BlackRock, which holds less than 1 percent, has pegged the value of its 2,279 shares in the company at $4,043,471, effectively estimating Byjus fair value at $8.4 billion as of March 31, 2023.',
        desc: 'BlackRock, the worlds largest asset management company (AMC), has reduced the fair value of Byjus, the worlds most-valued edtech startup, by 62 percent. This is the second time BlackRock has reduced the fair value of Byjus since October 2022. BlackRock, which holds less than 1 percent, has pegged the value of its 2,279 shares in the company at $4,043,471, effectively estimating Byjus fair value at $8.4 billion as of March 31, 2023. As of April last year, the company estimated Byjus valuation to be north of $22 billion, according to the AMCs filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the filings, BlackRock also sold shares in Byjs during the period. Byjus declined to comment. Inc42 first reported about the development. To be sure, these adjustments to fair values are typically based on AMCs internal assessment of the macro and microenvironment. They do not necessarily indicate a permanent markdown in the startups overall valuation. Blackrock also holds only a minority stake in the company and thus has access to limited information about the companys operations. The markdown, however, comes at a time when Byjus is gearing up for a massive fundraise worth almost a billion dollars, its second flat funding round, from a clutch of investors in the Middle East and the US. The company has already raised $250 million through structured instruments and is finalising another $700 million in equity.',
